\chapter{Setup}\label{chap:setup}
The basic setup consists of plugging the Mellanox ConnectX-3 NIC to the PCI-Express slot of the server,
cabling the server with the Spirent packet generator,
installation of the CentOS~7 GNU/Linux distribution, assigning IP adresses on all interconnected interfaces
and allowing IP forwarding (i.e. disabling netfilter).
Afterwards, the CentOS~7 routing performance can be measured, with the default configuration.

Further setup includes setting the {\it{performance}} scaling governor for better CPU utilisation,
disabling SELinux, disabling netfilter,
disabling the irqbalance daemon and assigning IRQ affinity manually.
These steps are focused on maximum performance in frames per second statistic
and on maximum CPU utilisation.
