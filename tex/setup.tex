Mellanox ConnectX-3 EN is an adapter that can run 10~Gigabit Ethernet, 40~Gigabit Ethernet,
or Infiniband at up to 56~Gbps~\cite{mellanox-product-brief}.
56~Gbps link speed can be achieved while connected to Mellanox switches.

By default, the driver uses adaptive interrupt moderation for the receive path, which adjusts the mod-
eration time to the traffic pattern~\cite{mellanox-user-manual}.

MSI - interrupt by writing to the specified address -> no 
Signaling an interrupt merely consists of sending a TLP over the bus,
which is simply a posted Write Request, with a special address,
which the host has written into the peripheral’s configuration space during initialization.
Any modern operating system (Linux included, of course) can then call the correct interrupt routine,
without the need to guess who generated the interrupt.
Neither is it really necessary to clear the interrupt,
if the peripheral doesn’t need the acknowledgment~\cite{pcie-tutorial-1}.
