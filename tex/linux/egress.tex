\section{Egress traffic processing}\label{sec:linux-egress}
The previous sections described how the frame reception works and the processing path
when the routing subsystem decides to forward them.
After the routing decision is made and the {\it{skb}} is passed to the {\it{ip\_finish\_output()}} function,
it is further passed back to the link layer of the networking stack.
This part of the Linux networking also provides interface to the device drivers
and handles traffic control~\cite{understanding-internals}.

In reference to the egress traffic processing, there are two important functions in this part of the stack -
{\it{dev\_queue\_xmit()}} and {\it{dev\_hard\_start\_xmit()}}.
The {\it{ip\_finish\_output()}} function of the IPv4 stack passes the outgoing {\it{skb}}
to the {\it{dev\_queue\_xmit()}} function, which determines
whether the device is queueless of queueful.
If the device is queueless, such as Loopback or Virtual interface, then the {\it{skb}} is passed to
{\it{dev\_hard\_start\_xmit()}} directly without any traffic control mechanism involved.
The {\it{dev\_hard\_start\_xmit()}} function further prepares the {\it{skb}} for transmission
and passes it to the transmission function of the device driver,
which instructs the device to transmit the frame on the wire~\cite{understanding-internals}.

If the device is queueful, such as almost any hardware network adapter, {\it{dev\_queue\_xmit()}}
executes the traffic control first~\cite{understanding-internals}.
The traffic control implemented in the Linux kernel uses algorithms known as queuing disciplines
(often abbreviated as {\it{qdisc}})
to arrange the frames in the desired order for transmission~\cite{understanding-internals}.
Figure~\ref{fig:linux-egress-packet} shows a brief overview of this part of the stack.

The Linux kernel supports various queuing disciplines, that can be configured by the {\it{tc}} utility.
The default queuing discipline for every network device is {\it{pfifo\_fast}}~\cite{linux-kernel-networking}.
The {\it{pfifo\_fast}} is a three-band First In First Out discipline.
As long as there are packets waiting in band 0, band 1 will not be processed.
Similarly, packets from band 1 are always processed before packets from band 2.
Within each band, a simple FIFO rule apply.
The kernel inserts the packets to one of the band according to the Type of Service flag of the packet~\cite{tcpip-in-linux}.
A more detailed discussion of the traffic control and its queuing disciplines is outside the scope of this thesis.

After the packet has been selected for transmission by the traffic control, it is passed to the
{\it{ndo\_start\_xmit()}} function, which is implemented by the device driver.
The packet is inserted to the hardware transmit queue by the driver and transmitted.
The hardware transmit queue is implemented as a ring buffer (TX ring)
and the DMA controller of the device uses it to fetch the egress frames~\cite{kernel-source}.

The adpater uses interrupts to notify the kernel when the transmission fails or succeeds.
Similarly to NET\_RX\_SOFTIRQ, which performs an interrupt-related work for incoming traffic,
the NET\_TX\_SOFTIRQ softirq handles the interrupt-related work for outgoing traffic.
The transmission code uses the softirq to mitigate interrupts in a similar fashion as the reception code.
Because different instances of the same softirq handler can run concurrently on different CPUs,
networking code is both low latency and scalable~\cite{understanding-internals}.
