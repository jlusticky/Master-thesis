\section{Benchmarking methodology}\label{sec:analysis-metodology}
Procedures described by RFC~2544 can be used to measure routing performance of the Linux kernel.
RFC~2544 specifies the benchmarking methodology for network interconnect devices.
The ideal way to implement the series of tests described in RFC~2544 is to use a tester
with both transmitting and receiving ports.
Connections are made from the sending ports of the tester to the receiving ports of the
device under test (DUT) and from the sending ports of the DUT back to the tester~\cite{rfc2544}.
Figure~\ref{fig:analysis-rfc2544} shows the test implementation.

Since the tester both sends the test traffic and receives
it back, after the traffic has been forwarded by the DUT, the tester
can easily determine if all of the transmitted packets were received~\cite{rfc2544}.
The Spirent TestCenter Application provides statistics about transmitted and received frames,
which can be used for this purpose.
