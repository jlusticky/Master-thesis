\subsection{Ethtool settings}\label{sub:analysis-settings-ethtool}
Ethtool is a standard Linux utility for manipulating network drivers and hardware, particularly for
wired Ethernet devices.
Supported offload features can be displayed using ethtool -{}-show-offload {\it{ifname}}.
Listing~\ref{lst:analysis-ethtool-offload} shows output of ethtool -{}-show-offload eth0,
where eth0 is the Mellanox ConnectX-3 adapter.

Selected offload features can be enabled by ethtool -{}-offload {\it{devname}} {\it{feature}} on,
or disabled by ethtool -{}-offload {\it{devname}} {\it{feature}} off.
The features listed as [fixed] cannot be changed on this particular NIC.
The rest of the features can be changed, but the feature name differs when executing ethtool -{}-offload.
For example, the rx-checksumming feature is turned on by ethtool -{}-offload eth0 {\it{rx}} on.
Similarly, the scatter-gather feature is turned on by ethtool -{}-offload eth0 {\it{sg}} on.
For more information about using ethtool, the man page of ethool(8) should be consulted.

Listing~\ref{lst:analysis-ethtool-offload} shows that all supported offload features not marked as [fixed] are enabled.

%\subsection{Neighboring}
%The destination link layer address must be present in the ARP cache to avoid aditional delay of packet transmission.
%The description of the neighboring implementation is outside the scope of this thesis.
%The amount of ARP and Neighbor Discovery messages is negligible compared to the
%amount of the actual traffic and it is not considered by the measurements.
%However, their processing is not.

%TX,RX RING buffer sizes:
%Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in packet-switched networks generally,
%in which excess buffering of packets causes high latency and packet delay variation (also known as jitter),
%as well as reducing the overall network throughput.
%When a router device is configured to use excessively large buffers,
%even very high-speed networks can become practically unusable for many interactive applications like voice calls,
%chat, and even web surfing. %cite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_scheduler
