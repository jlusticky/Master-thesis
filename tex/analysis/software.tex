The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 operating system features 40 Gb Ethernet support and
the kernel based on upstream version 3.10~\cite{rhel-7-announce}.
To avoid licensing fees, CentOS 7 was chosen for experiments.
CentOS 7 provides support for the 40 Gigabit Ethernet protocol and a binary compatible kernel with RHEL 7~\cite{centos-7-announce}.

Mellanox ConnectX-3 EN is supported by the mlx4 driver found in the
{\it{drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx4}} directory of the Linux kernel source code~\cite{kernel-source}.
It is the low level driver implementation for the Connect-X adapters designed by Mellanox Technologies.
Some Connect-X adpaters can operate as an InfiniBand adapter and as an Ethernet NIC~\cite{mellanox-user-manual}.
To accommodate the two flavors, the driver is split into modules mlx4\_core, mlx4\_en and mlx4\_ib.
The mlx4\_core module handles low-level functions like device initialisation and firmware commands processing.
The mlx4\_en module handles Ethernet specific functions and
plugs into the network device layer of the Linux kernel.
Similarly, the mlx4\_ib module handles Infiniband specific functions~\cite{mellanox-user-manual}.

%Vanilla upstream Linux kernel 3.18.1 released on 16th December 2014.
Spirent TestCenter Application version 4.46 is provided to use the Spirent hardware packet generator.
The application allows to create virtual devices connected to selected ports.
The devices can use a full-featured IPv4 or IPv6 stack, including ARP/ND, ICMP, TCP/UDP etc~\cite{spirent-app}.
