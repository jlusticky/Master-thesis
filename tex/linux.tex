\chapter{Networking in the Linux kernel}\label{chap:linux}
The Linux kernel version 3.10 consists of nearly 17 million lines of code
and the networking is arguably half of the kernel.
The GNU/Linux operating system is used in a wide range of routers.
Ranging from home and small office routers, to enterprise routers and
core high-speed routers on the Internet backbone~\cite{linux-by-numbers}.

In reference to the ISO/OSI layered model of network,
the kernel does not handle any layer above L4.
Those layers (the session, presentation and application layers) are
handled solely by user-space applications.
The physical layer (L1) is also not handled by the Linux kernel,
but by the network interface card~\cite{linux-kernel-networking}.
Each layer is handled by its corresponding subsystem in the kernel.
Figure~\ref{fig:linux-layers} shows the distribution of responsibilities for each layer of the ISO/OSI model.

Every received incoming frame is passed to the kernel.
For a DMA-capable network card, the kernel allocates a buffer from its memory (receive ring buffer) and passes its descriptor to the
device driver during the device initialisation.
These descriptors are used to store the frames received on the network card by using DMA transfers~\cite{tcpip-in-linux}.
A buffer descriptor indicates where the buffer resides in the kernel memory and how big the buffer is.
The purpose of the DMA transfer is to move data without CPU intervention.
Once a complete frame is transferred using a device DMA transfer,
the device raises an interrupt to inform the kernel about the received data~\cite{tcpip-in-linux}.

Each received packet is then handled by a matching L3 protocol handler.
An IPv4 packet is handled by the {\it{ip\_rcv()}} function
and an IPv6 packet by {\it{ipv6\_rcv()}}~\cite{linux-kernel-networking}.
Similarly, each outgoing packet is passed downwards through the layers of the network stack.
The device driver is associated with a specific link type (e.g. Ethernet),
so it knows how to interpret the L2 header
and extract the information about which L3 protocol is encapsulated~\cite{understanding-internals}.

Figure~\ref{fig:linux-flow} shows an overview of the traffic flow in the Linux kernel described above.
Parts that are discussed in this thesis include the Forward path for IPv4 packets (routing),
Ingress traffic control, Egress traffic control and the Fastroute feature, which is mentioned briefly
as it is no longer supported~\cite{linux-kernel-networking}.
The hardware of NICs, Neighboring and L4 protocols are not discussed in this thesis.
As the packet passes through different layers of the stack,
the kernel manipulates it using an internal data structure, called {\it{socket buffer}}.
This structure contains the actual packet, but it is not copied between layers.
Instead, a pointer to the structure is passed when passing the packet through the stack~\cite{understanding-internals}.
