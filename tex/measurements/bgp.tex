The following measurement is perfomed with the Internet routes obtained from RIPE's BGP data.
The data contains 538~738 routes at the time of writing.
The complete setup of loading the routes into the kernel's FIB is described in appendix~\ref{app:bgp}.
The FIB statistics are exported via the {\it{/proc/net/fib\_triestat}} file, as described in
subsection~\ref{sub:analysis-metodology-collection}.
