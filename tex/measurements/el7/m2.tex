\subsection{Measurement 2 - default configuration - 32 IPv4 flows}
Since the Linux kernel scaling mechanisms described in section~\ref{sec:linux-scaling}
are based on processing each flow by a different CPU,
the routing performance of the default configuration was tested against 32 IPv4 flows.

\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | }
\hline
Frame size & \% of link & bandwidth & frame rate \\
\hline
64     &  2.69\% &  1.08~Gb/s & 1~550~000 \\
594    & 19.65\% &  7.86~Gb/s & 1~600~000 \\
1518   & 49.22\% & 19.69~Gb/s & 1~650~000 \\
AMS-IX & 24.34\% &  9.74~Gb/s & 1~600~000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

As expected, the scaling mechanisms help to increase the routing performance of the Linux kernel.
The scaling mechanisms perform better when forwarding larger frames.
This may be caused by differences in memory management allocations,
since the memory management is common for all CPUs present in the system.
