\subsection{Measurement 1 - default configuration - single IPv4 flow}
The first measurement shows the routing perfomance with
IP addresses assigned, IP forwarding enabled and Netfilter rules flushed.

The IP addresses were assigned as described in section~\ref{sec:setup-server}.
The IP forwarding was enabled by echoing "1" to the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip\_forward file and the Netfilter rules
were flushed using {\it{iptables -F}}, because the default rules do not allow forwarding.
