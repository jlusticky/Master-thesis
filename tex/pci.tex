MSI - interrupt by writing to the specified address -> no 
Signaling an interrupt merely consists of sending a TLP over the bus,
which is simply a posted Write Request, with a special address,
which the host has written into the peripheral’s configuration space during initialization.
Any modern operating system (Linux included, of course) can then call the correct interrupt routine,
without the need to guess who generated the interrupt.
Neither is it really necessary to “clear” the interrupt, if the peripheral doesn’t need the acknowledgment.
