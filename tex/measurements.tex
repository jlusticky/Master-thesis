\chapter{Measurements}\label{chap:measurements}
The results presented in this thesis are based on the setup and basic settings described in chapter~\ref{chap:setup}.
The CentOS~7 operating system
was installed on the server with two Intel Xeon E5-2660 v3 CPUs
and Mellanox ConnectX-3 EN 40~Gbps Ethernet adapter, as described in section~\ref{sec:analysis-hardware}.
Each measurement put the server under 60~seconds of constant unidirectional traffic load,
as described in section~\ref{sec:analysis-metodology}.
Unless stated otherwise,
the bandwidth use is configured in frames per second with a unit of margin 50~000.

\section{CentOS~7 distribution kernel 3.10.0-123}
The CentOS~7 distribution kernel version 3.10.0-123.20.1.el7.x86\_64
was used in the measurements presented in this section.

\section{Upstream mainline kernel 4.0.2}
The following measurements use the upstream Linux kernel downloaded form elrepo, as described in~\ref{sec:analysis-software}.
This is the latest upstream kernel version as of 6th May 2015.
%This allows to use up to 16 queues with RSS.
%The Hyper-Threading must be enabled in order to have at least 16 cores.
%TODO 16 front + HT

\section{Settings influence}
There are various system settings, which can impact the routing performance of the GNU/Linux-based system.
The influence of some the most interesting settings is demonstrated by the following measurements.

\section{Summary}
The Linux kernel is able to forward up to 5.9~million frames per second
with the system settings used in the measurements,
while the default configuration limits the performance to 1.6~million frames per second.
The most significant performance drop is caused by the Reverse path filtering feature,
which requires to perform the FIB lookup twice for each packet.
Disabling the Hyper-Threading technology provides a negligable performance improvement.
The FIB lookup with imported prefixes from the BGP table does not introduce a large performance drop
thanks to the CPU's 20~MB L3 cache.
Figure~\ref{fig:measurements-overview} shows the presented results.
Further performance improvement may require Linux kernel recompilation.
