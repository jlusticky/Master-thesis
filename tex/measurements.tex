\chapter{Measurements}\label{chap:measurements}
The results presented in this thesis are based on the setup and basic settings described in chapter~\ref{chap:setup}.
The CentOS~7 operating system
was installed on a server equipped with two Intel Xeon E5-2660 v3 CPUs
and Mellanox ConnectX-3 EN 40~Gbps ethernet adapter, as described in section~\ref{sec:analysis-hardware}.
Unless stated otherwise,
the bandwidth use is configured in frames per second with a unit of margin 50~000.

\section{CentOS~7 distribution kernel 3.10}
The CentOS~7 distribution kernel version 3.10.0-123.20.1.el7.x86\_64
was used in the measurements presented in this section.

\section{Settings influence}

	\input{measurements/ht.tex}
	
The following measurements take only the AMS-IX distribution and 32 IPv4 flows into account.
The measurements are performed with HT disabled,
therefore the previous result of 5~900~000 frames per second can be used for comparision.

	\input{measurements/rp_filter.tex}

	\input{measurements/selinux.tex}

	%netfilter
	%netfilter 1000 ip table rules
	%netfilter - masquerade == nat
