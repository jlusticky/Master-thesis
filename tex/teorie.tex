40Gbit and 100Gbit over Ethernet - IEEE 802.3ba ratified in 2010.
10GBASE-T (4-pair copper Cat.8 twisted-pair) ratified in 2013.
8P8C modular connector (RJ45).

Then you have QSFP, which is a quad SFP [connection]. So to get to 40 GbE today, you take four lanes of [10 Gbps] and run them together. You can get to 100 GbE by taking 10 lanes of 10 Gbps.

ConnectX-3 is a 10/40GbE adapter for VMware ESXi 5.0 that provides virtual protocol interconnect, meaning it can run 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40Gb Ethernet, or Infiniband at up to 56Gb per second from the same card.

RDMA - remote direct memory access.
RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE).
