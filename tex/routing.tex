Forwarding information base.
There are two routing tables by default (in case of non policy routing):
local FIB table
main FIB table

include/net/ip_fib.h


Routes can be introduced to the main routing table in one of three ways:
by system administrator command ('ip route add' or 'route add' which is obsolete)
by routing daemons
as a result of ICMP Redirect

A routing table is implemented by struct fib_table.
There is one routing cache, regardless of how many routing tables there are.
The routing cache can be viewed by running 'ip route show cache' or 'route -C' (/proc/net/rt_cache).

The routing cache consists of rtable elements.
