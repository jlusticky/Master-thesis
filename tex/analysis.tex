\section{Generating 40 Gigabit traffic}
% - selecting packet generator and how to measure
Generating 40 Gigabit traffic is not an easy task.
Basicaly, there are two choices how to generate such a traffic.
Either by using traditional software packet generator,
limited by the CPU speed and the optimisation level of the software,
or use a specialised hardware packet generator.

Software packet generators:
the most known pktgen,
netmap with VALE framework.

Spirent Communications is a hardware packet generator vendor,
oriented in network testing for enterprises and data centres. % TODO ~\cite{spirent}.
Among their products, a hardware packet generator called Spirent % TODO
can be found.
