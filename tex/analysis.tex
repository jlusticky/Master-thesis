\chapter{Analysis}\label{chap:analysis}
Basically, there are three important parts needed to perform network benchmarks at full 40~Gbit speed -
a network interface card with 40~Gigabit Ethernet support, a server compatible with the card and a packet generator
capable of generating 40~Gbps network traffic.
A chosen distribution of the GNU/Linux operating system should contain a stable and
recent kernel that supports the 40~Gb Ethernet protocol, the network interface card
and the features described in chapter~\ref{chap:linux}.
